You can view all bans, mutes and kicks at reaction-mc-bans/view [reaction-mc-bans/view](http://reactionmc.comuf.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Links\r\nVote at dft.ba/-reactionvote\r\nForums are located at dft.ba/-reactionpvp\r\n--Comments, questions, feedback are all left on the forums.\r\nDonate at dft.ba/-donorshop\r\n\r\n\r\n### Moderator Jurisdiction \r\nModerators only moderate the chat -- if you view another bannable offense please report it with proof to the apropriate people. You guys / gals cannot deal with any of the following:\r\n- Hacked clients, xray, nodus, etc\r\n- Previous actions of players\r\n- Accepting or denying ban appeals or user applications\r\n- Major griefing\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with something another mod did, let us know, not them. Please do not undo stuff that a different mod does, and do not get into a flame war with another mod, or even question something another mod does with them. Bring it up with Hidden_Lurker as he leads the Staff department, but you can also talk to SomethingAwes0me if it's an urgent situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Moderator Demotions\r\nModerators can be demoted for various reasons. Those include, abusing ban powers by banning people who do not deserve a ban, outstepping moderator jurisdiction, banning admins or owners, server defamation, server disrespect, fighting with users, disrespecting users, not remaining unbiased, and loss of trust.  Also, if you are offline for 14 consecutive days, without a prior exception, or letting a owner know you may be demoted. You may also be demoted if we think that you aren't a good fit, or aren't contributing enough too the staff team. Please do not worry too much about this, really :).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions?\r\nIf you have questions ask a Sr Mod, Admin or Owner -- better to be safe than sorry!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Moderator Guidelines\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page Now starts the important part of this, the actual guidelines. These will tell you a general idea of what to do when someone does something against the rules. These should only be used as a reference guide, always use discretion and common sense.\r\n \r\n\r\nNote: There will be three parts to each rule infraction, example. There will be the rule they are breaking, an example and what to do on the first/second or third offense. If under what to do, it says [Discrestion], do what you think is right. If it says [Warning] warn the player by telling them what they did wrong, and what will happen if they continue. If it says [Kick] use the kick command, and so on with [Ban] and [Tempban].\r\n\r\n\r\n### Guidelines\r\n\r\n \r\n1.

Staff promotions are based solely upon Owner decisions and are not guaranteed. If you feel there is a gray area do what you think is best for the server, but ask if at all possible. Thank you for reading and good luck!\r\n"}
